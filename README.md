# Chapter 1. Management 101

## What to Expect From a Manager

### One-on-One Meetings

- Create human connection between you and manager
  - **Great managers notice when your normal energy level change**
  - Bed rock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust
- Speak privately with manager about whatever needs discussing

### Feedback and Workplace Guidance

- Should expect feedback from manager
  - *If constructive feedback, this is going to be uncomfortable - that's okay*
- Delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something
- Praising positive behavior in public is a best practice because it reinforces what positive behavior looks like
- Manager should be number one apply
  - If struggling w/ a teammate or a person on another team, your manager should be there to help you navigate that situation
- Great when managers can identify and assign stretch projects that help us grow and learn new things
- Good managers will understand the value of the work you're doing even when it is not fun or glamorous
- Manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team's goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work

### Training and Career Growth

- Manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth
- As individual contributor, responsible for figuring out what types of training you want
- When looking for a promotion, good manager should know what the system is looking for and can help you build those achievements and skills

## How to Be Managed

- Not same as managing up but similar

### Spend Time Thinking About What You Want

- The onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on *your* shoulders

### You Are Responsible for Yourself

- Go after what you want
- Bring agendas to your 1-1s when you have things you need to talk about
- Seek out feedback, especially constructive feedback on areas to improve
- If you want something, ask for it

### Give Your Manager a Break

- Manager's job is too do the best thing for the company and the team
- As you become more senior, manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems
- Ask for advice

### Choose Your Managers Wisely

- Manager can make a huge difference in your career
- They can get you promoted; they can get you attention and feedback from important people
- Plenty of great engineers make ineffective managers because they don't know or want to deal with the politics of leadership in their companies

## Assessing Your Own Experience

- Have you had a manager you considered good? What did this manager do that you found valuable?
- How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager? Do you come to 1-1s with your manager bringing topics to discuss? If your 1-1 is a status meeting, can you use some other means to convey that status?
- Do you feel that you can tell your manager when you have a major life event? Do you feel that your manager knows something about you personally?
- Has your manager delivered good feedback to you? Bad feedback? Any feedback at all?
- Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?

# Chapter 4. Managing People

- *Hard to accept that "new manager" is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that's the best mindset with which to start leading*
- Learning to manage individuals while also being responsible for running a team

## Starting a New Reporting Relationship Off Right

- When you start managing you take on people as direct reports

### Build Trust and Rapport

- One strategy is to ask a series of questions that are intended to help you get to know the aspects of the person that impact your ability to manage him well
  - How do you like to be praised, in public or in private? 
    - Some people really hate to be praised in public. You want to know this. 
  - What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback? 
  - Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?
  - How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of? 
    - Maybe a direct report fasts for religious reasons, which sometimes makes him cranky. Maybe he always gets stressed out while on-call. Maybe he hates reviews season. 
  - Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate? 
    - If you asked me this question, my answer would be: skipping or rescheduling 1-1s, neglecting to give me feedback, and avoiding difficult conversations. 
  - Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them? 
  - Any surprises since you’ve joined, good or bad, that I should know about? 
    - Things like: Where are my stock options? You promised me a relocation bonus and I haven’t gotten it yet. Why are we using SVN and not Git? I didn’t expect to be so productive already!

### Create a 30/60/90 Day Plan

- Can include basic goals (getting up to speed on code), committing a bug fix, performing a release, etc
- The more senior the hire, the more he should participate in creating the plan
- Create a set of milestones based on prior hires, current state of tech and project, and level of person coming in 

### Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation

- Aspect of onboarding will likely be contributing to the team's onboarding documentation

### Communicate Your Style and Expectations

- New hire needs to understand your expectations and your style as much as you need to understand his
  - If you expect him to send you a weekly summary of his progress via email, tell him
  - How long should he work alone trying to solve a problem, and at what point he should ask for help

### Get Feedback from Your New Hire

- Get as much feedback as you can (take w/ a grain of salt) about the new hire's perspective on the team in that first 90 days
  - Person has fresh eyes

## Communicating with Your Team


### Have Regular 1-1s

- Unless you have many many years of management experience, you should setup regularly scheduled 1-1s

### Scheduling 1-1s

- Default is weekly and adjust from there
- Try not to set time that is during productive working hours

### Adjusting 1-1s

- Number of factors to take into consideration
  - How often do you interact w/ this person offhand during the week
  - How much coaching does this person need
  - **How much does this person push information up to you**
  - How good is your relationship with this person
  - How stable or unstable are things in the team or the company

## Different 1-1 Styles

### The To-Do List Meeting

- On or both parties come in with a list of objectives to cover, and the parties cover these objectives in order of importance
- Updates are given, decisions are made or discussed, planning happens
- Could keep a list of topics in a spreadsheet that is shareable between manager and reports

### The Catch-up

- First goal is to listen to anything direct reports want to discuss
- Want meeting to be driven by them
- Be careful this doesn't become a complaining session
  - Problems in the workplace need be either dealt with or put aside by mutual agreement

### The Feedback Meeting

- Sometimes devoted to informal feedback and coaching
- Good to hold these especially for early-career employees
- If you have an employee with a performance issue, feedback meetings should happen more frequently, and if you're thinking of firing someone I advise you to document these feedback meetings
  - Will include issues you discussed and the expectations that you set with the person
- When someone does something that needs immediate feedback don't wait for the 1-1 to provide the feedback - address it as soon as possible
- When something goes well, don't save up your praise - give it freely in the moment

### The Progress Report

- When managing managers, a lot of 1-1s will be diving into details of projects they're overseeing so that you don't have time to dig into on your own
- Only time you should be doing this with a handful of individual contributors is when you have someone who's off on a side project that your'e not personally overseeing

### Getting to Know You

- Leave room to get to know the person reporting to you as a human being
- Show you care about them as individuals
- Get to know their career so far, and ask them about their long-term career goals

### Mix It Up

- *Keep notes in a shared document* (manager should be note taker)
- For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator

- Be wary of micromanagement
  - A high-stress project can't be allowed to slip seems at risk, and so you step in to correct it
  - You delegate something, but then discover that you don't like the technical choices the team has made to implement it, so you tell them to rewrite it
- Be there for your tech lead
  - Work with them to determine which meetings to attend
  - Help the lead understand which details to escalate to you
- Sometimes micromanagement is necessary
  - A junior engineer may thrive under the detailed oversight
  - Some projects go off the rails, and you occasionally need to override decisions made by your reports that could have big negative repercussions
  - *Micromanagement should not be default approach*
- Trust and control are main issues around micromanagement
  - If you're micromanaging someone, chances are you're doing it because you don't trust that the task will be done right, or you want to very tightly control the outcome so that it meets your exact standards
    - Common when talented engineers become manager
- Deadlines will inevitably slip - be wary that stepping in to help does not reinforce the micromanagement style
- *Autonomy* is a huge motivator for people - nothign worse than feeling you can't make a single decision on your own
- *Delegation is not the same thing as abdication*
  - When you're delegating responsibility, you're still expected to be involved as much as necessary to help the project succeed - support the person as much as possible when delegating`

## Practical Advice for Delegating Effectively

### Use the Team's Goals to Understand Which Details You Should Dig Into

- When you feel like you want to micromanage, ask the team how they're measuring their success and ask them to make that visible to you on an ongoing basis
  - If you get nothing after a week or two, may need to do a course correction
- *If the team is making progress on its goals, the systems are stable, and the product manager is happy, rarely dig into details beyond cursory overview*
- When you are managing a team that doesn't have a clear plan, use the details you'd want to monitor to help them create one
  - What are you holding them accountable again this month, this quarter, or this year?
    - If you can't answer that question, the first tep is to help the team create those goals

### Gather Information from the Systems Before Going to the People

- If you want to know the status of work, look at the version control system and the ticketing system
- If you want to know how stable the systems are, subscribe to information about the alerts, look at the metrics, follow what has happened in on-call
- *If you can go get information yourselves, go get it, don't constantly ask the team for information you can find yourself*
- It's okay to ask for status summaries and okay to use your team as a way of surfacing the most important information from all of these sources

### Adjust Your Focus Depending on the Stage of Projects

- If you're manaaging a single team or two directly, you should know all of the details of the project status as part of your regular team processes (like team standups)
- In beginning and design stages of a project, you may want to be more involved in order to facilitate a good set of project goals or a good system design
- When you're close to a delivery date, progress details become more important, because there are more decisions to be made and those specifics convey much more actionable info
- During normal workflow, enough to know what's moving forward and what is taking longer than expected
  - Can use that info to reshuffle work or help a struggling team member


### Establish Standards for Code and Systems

  
### Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Netural to Positive Way

- If someone is struggling, you want that person to communicate that
- You want to teach your team to communicate - both when and how
- You never want people to hide information about issues
- Getting stuck on a problem or making a mistake is often just an opportunity for learning

### Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback

- Continuous feedback is a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback
- As soon as possible, note when things are going well and raise issues as they happen
- Getting into the habit of continuous feedback is training you to pay attention to individuals, this makes it easier to recognize and foster talent
- Gives good experience of having small and sometimes tricky conversations with individuals about their performance
- Some steps you can take to be great at giving continuous back
  - Know your people
    - What are their goals? What are their strengths and weaknesses? Can get some of this from past performance reviews. Will want to sit down with every person on your team and ask for his or her perspective on all of these questions
  - Observe your people
    - Put effort into paying attention to the individuals on your team
    - Practice looking for talents and achievements on your team
    - Adopt a habit of positive recognition to force you to be on the lookout for things to praise
    - Look for something to recognize weekly for everyone who reports to you
  - Provide lightweight, regular feedback
    - Start w/ positive feedback
    - People respond better to praise than they do to corrective feedback, and you can use kudos to guide them to better behavior by emphasizing the things they've done well
    - Positive feedback makes your reports more likely to listen to you when you need to give them critical feedback
  - Bonus: Provide coaching
    - Continuous feedback worst best when you pair that feedback with coaching
    - Use coaching to ask people what they might have done differently
    - When things are going well, praise them, but also make suggestions as to what could be even better in the future
    - *This isn't a core need for doing the job well - save your coaching time for those who are receptive to it*

## Performance Reviews

- *360 model* is a performance review that includes feedback from person's manager, that person's teammates, anyone who reports to that person, and anyone the person interacts with regularly
- Give a good high-level view into what other people are thinking about your direct reports

# Chapter 5. Managing a team

- It's easy for new managers to get overly focused on the people-related tasks - you still need to focus more on technical, strategic, and leadership areas of managing a team

## Staying Technical

- Job will require that you guide technical decision making
- As the manager of a team, you have the job of holding people accountable for their decisions and of making sure that the decisions pass the technical smell test and have been balanced against the overall context of the team and the business
- Need to balance new responsibilities with staying in the code and knowing how the system really works
  - Helps identify where the bottlenecks and process problems are
    - If the build is really slow or deploying code takes too long or on-call is a nightmare, you'll feel it in the difficulties of trying to complete a simple task
    - Easier to identify technical debt and prioritize dealing with it when you've struggled through the code
- As the manager of a team, you'll be called upon to help guide what is possible and impossible to do in your systems
  - When PM has a crazy idea, it's much easier to manage when you're confident in your ability to evaluate how easy that feature will be to implement in the given system
  - A critical part of complex project management is understanding the pieces of the system well enough to determine the best path to implementation

## Debugging Dysfunctional Teams: The Basics

- Team keeps missing deliverables, people are unhappy, they keep quitting, etc

### Not Shipping

- Even teams that are deep into research have goals and deliverables
- People feel good when they set small goals and meet them regularly
- You may worry about pushing them too hard, and so you let them miss deadlines w/o a fuss
  - Trick is to learn how to balance pushing your team and holding back
  - If you're still writing code, may be good to roll up your sleeves and help the team meet deliverables
  - Dig into the part of the project that's slipping and partner with engineers responsible to help understand the situation
- Sometimes teams aren't shipping because tools and processes they'be been using make it hard to get work done quickly - infrequent releases can hide pain points

### People Drama

### Unhappiness Due to Overwork

- Usually, unhappiness due to overwork is usually has a root in problems you can address
  - If overwork is due to instability of production systems, product roadmap should be slowed down to focus on stability for awhile
  - Make clear measures of alerts, downtime, and incidents, and strive to reduce them
  - Dedicate 20% of your time in every planning session to system sustainability work
- If you're in a crunch period, do everything you can to support the team
  - Order team
  - Tell (and give) them explicit break time after the push
  - Make it fun in the moment - this period can serve as a bonding experience for the team
- Learn from this crunch period and avoid it next time

### Collaboration Problems

- Team isn't working well w/ product team, design team, another team tech, etc 
  - Gathering actionable feedback from your team, and have productive conversations about improvements
- If team isn't working well together, look into creating some opportunities for them to hangout w/o it being all about work
  - Most introverts want to have a feeling of relatedness w/ their team
- Be sensitive to the fact that you are likely the manager of some of your former peers
- Going to have to let go of some of previous work as you ease into the additional responsibilities of people management
  - Good opportunity to give former peers mor control over some of the technical work you use to own
  - Give new challenges to more junior members of the team
- Goal is to show team that you're committed to helping them succeed

## The Shield

- Many pieces of management advice tell new managers that part of their job is to be a shield for the team
- Shielding teams from distraction is important, but really the goal is helping them understand the key important goals and focusing them on those goals is important
- It's important for teams to know context for goals
  - If a critical system needs to be up in November, the team needs to know this
  - Appropriate context is what helps teams make good decisions about how and where to focus their energy

## How to Drive Good Decisions

- Product manager owns product roadmap and set of business features that your team has committed to working on
- Tech lead is deep in the technology but also thinking about project management and the work that needs to be done
- Manager is usually held accountable for team's progress 
  - While you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you'll still be judged by how well those decisions turned out

### Create a Data-Driven Team Culture

### Flex Your Own Product Muscles

- Hone your understanding of what is important to your customer
- Taking the time to develop customer empathy is important because you'll need to give your engineers context for their work

### Look into the Future

- Need to think ahead from a product and technology perspective
- Getting a sense of where the product roadmap is going helps you guide the technology roadmap
- Start asking the product team questions about what the future might look like, and spend some time keeping up with technological developments that might change the way you think about the software you're writing or the way you're operating it

### Review the Outcome of Your Decisions and Projects

- Talk about whether the hypotheses you used to motivate projects actually turned out to be true
- Was it true that the team moved faster after you rewrote that system?
- Did customer behavior change in the way the product team predicted when you added the new feature
- *If you make this a habit for yourself and your team, you'll always learn from your decisions*

### Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day

- Regular process retrospective has a lot of value
- Is the team feeling good about how they get requirements?
- Do they feel good about code quality?
- More subjective than gathering data about the team's health but can be more valuable

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer

### The Dos and Dont's of Managing Conflict

- **Don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting**
  - Don't set people up for votes that you know will fail instead of taking the responsibility as a manager of delivering that bad news yourself
- **Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions**
  - When you want to allow for group decision making, the group needs to have a clear set of standards that they use to evaluate decisions
    - Goals, risks, and answers to any outstanding questions
- **Don't turn a blind eye to simmering issues**
  - If you're giving negative feedback in the course of a performance review, it shouldn't be a major surprise to your employee
- **Do address issues w/o courting drama**
  - You want to allow space for people to express frustrating, but mind the difference between letting off steam and a real interpersonal issue
    - Use your judgement as to what should be addressed and what should be dropped
- **Don't take it out on other teams**
  - Don't take your desire for accountability out on other teams
  - If you're team is missing that extra 10% they need, express that to the team in a healthy manner
- **Do remember to be kind. It's natural to want to be liked by other people**
  - It's kind to tell someone who isn't ready for a promotion that she isn't ready, and back that up with work she needs to do to get there
  - It's part of the manager's job to have these difficult conversations
- **Don't be afraid**
  - Conflict avoidance often arises from fear
  - Scared of responsibility of making decisions, afraid of seeming to demanding, afraid people will quit if we give them uncomfortable feedback
- **Do get curious**
  - Thinking about your actions is the best way to combat fear of conflict
    - *Am I pushing this decision to the team because they really are the best people to decide, or am I just afraid that if I make an unpopular but necessary decision people will be mad at me?*
  - Be thoughtful about your behavior, and it's unlikely that you'll seek out unnecessary conflict

## Challenging Situations: Team Cohesion Destroyers

- One critical element of creating functional teams is building teams that work wel and happily together
- Goal is psychological safety - a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another
- Build relationships with team members - ask them how they are doing
- Teams that are friendly are happier, gel faster, and tend to produce better results
- People that undermine team cohesion are very problematic - usually referred to as *toxic*

### The Brilliant Jerk

- Produces individually out-sized results but creates mixture of fear and dislike in almost everyone around her
- Bullies with intellect, usually lets frustration out openly with anyone they see as stupid
- Best way to avoid is to simply not hire one
- As a manager, unlikely that you alone will be able to convince them that their behavior is a problem
- Best thing you can do for your team that contains a brilliant jerk is to openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior
  - When a person is behaving badly in a way that is having a visible impact on the team, you need to say something at the moment to make the standard clear
    - Delivering this message in public is walking a fine line
    - You don't want to seem emotional
    - *This should only for behavior you feel is detrimental to the whole group*

### The Noncommunicator

- Person who hides information from you, from his teammates, from his product manager
- Have to nip this habit in the bud as soon as possible
- Sometimes this is a sign the person thinks they should have more responsibility and who doesn't respect his manager
- Try to address the root cause of the hiding
  - Is the person afraid of being criticized
- If team is rejecting the individual, you will need to decide whether to correct the team or move the individual to another team

### The Employee Who Lacks Respect

- Person who simply doesn't respect you as a manager or who doesn't respect teammates
- Ask them if they want tobe on your team
- If they do, lay out expectations
- You can't have a person working for you who doesn't respect you or doesn't respect the team

## Advanced Project Management

- As manager, you will help set schedule for team
- Larger organization works to figure out what the plans for the quarter or year might look like, you'll estimate whether your team can do certain projects, how much work those projects might be, and whether you have the right people to complete the work
- You might be asked if your team can take on the support of old systems in addition to their current commitments, or how many people you'd need to hire in order to support a new initiative

<br>

- As the manager, you may push some of the project planning onto your tech lead, but you'll likely need to do some of that work yourself
- You'll probably be asked for rough estimates as to when work will be done

### Project Management Rules of Thumb

- **None of this is a replacement for agile project management**
- You are responsible for the larger picture - the accomplishments that are measured in months instead of weeks - and this is where you have to start exerting some higher-level planning

#### You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter

- Vacations, meetings, reviews, outages, onboarding - all of these things take away from focus
- Q1 (after winter holidays) will likely be the most productive and Q4 (quarter that includes end-of-year holidays) will be least productive

#### Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board

- Testing debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions
- If you make this a habit, you can use it to tackle some of the midsize legacy code every quarter and get some decent improvements

#### As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no

- Only way to achieve goals is to cut scope at the end of the project
- You will partner with your tech lead and product lead/business representative to figure out real "must-haves"
- *You will need to figure out when to push for a hack implementation and when to hold back for the right implementation*
- You will need to explain the cost to get their vision

#### Use the doubling rule for quick estimations, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks

- **Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it**
- This is good and appropriate when you're asked for an off-the-cuff guess
- When talking about projects that you think will take longer than a couple of weeks, go ahead and double the estimate, but make it clear that you'll need some planning time before you're sure about it
- Sometimes the longer tasks will take far more than twice your estimate, and it's worth spending some time planning more carefully before committing team to big unknown project

#### Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate

- Responsible for handling uncertainty and limiting how much of that uncertainty you expose to your team
- Try to get a teamwide process in place for talking about new features and customer complaints, and limit estimations that occur outside that process

<br>

- If you're a new manager in a new team/company - you need to slow down and understand the current processes
  - What does adding a new feature look like
  - What does deployment look like
  - What does support look like
  - What do the code bases look like
  - How does the system work and what does the architecture look like

# Chapter 6. Managing Multiple Teams

- At this point you are most likely writing very little, if any, production code
- Code reviews are a good thing to stay involved with to stay on top of changes in the system
- If you created systems when you were more hands-on, stay engaged with those systems, because you'll remember the details better than most, and you can help engineers working in those systems with code reviews and questions
- These things are good at keeping you in tune with the feeling of software development and showing you teams that you are willing and able to help out with day-to-day in a valuable way

<br>

- Management has fewer obvious quick wins, especially for newer managers
- *Becoming a great manager requires you to focus on the skills of management, and that requires giving up some of your technical focus*

## Managing Your Time: What's Important, Anyway?

- *Understand the difference between importance and urgency*

![](./images/img.png)

- If it's important and urgent, you're doing it
  - Could be a major outage helping to fix
- Urgency is often more clearly felt than importance
  - *Read and respond to email at specific times of the day*
- If you have a meeting on your calendar is it really urgent?
- You're likely spending a lot of your time on things that are urgent but only slightly important
  - One example is actually preparing for meetings so that you can guide them in a healthy way
  - Ask for agenda items up front
- Any sort of standard meeting that involves a group of people (planning, retro, postmortem) should have a clear procedure and expected outcomes

-----------------

- Your boss will expect you to manage yourself and your teams independently
- Your manager trusts you to proactively deal with all those important but not urgent things before they become urgent

-----------------

- Meetings can fall into that urgent but not important category - don't go to the meeting when you're not clearly needed
- Don't skip internal meetings - important to gauge happiness of team

-----------------

- Thinking about the future is high on this list
- There no doubt things that you know you should do but have put off
- If you don't set aside some time to focus on these things, they'll sneak up in negative ways
- Responsible for knowing details of teams today AND also looking at where you need to be going in the future and what you need to get there
- Start to ask yourself:
  - *How important is the thing that I'm doing*
  - *How much time have I spent this week on urgent things*
  - *Have I managed to carve out enough time for things that are not urgent*

## Decisions and Delegation

![](./images/img_1.png)

### Handle Simple and Infrequent Tasks Yourself

- If it's faster to do something yourself than it would be to explain it to someone else and it rarely needs to be done, you should do it yourself

### Delegate Complex and Frequent Tasks to Develop Your Team

- *Goal is to make teams capable of operating at a high level without much input from you, and that means that they'll need individuals who can take over these complex tasks and run them without you around
- List the tasks that you and only you really know how to do for the team
  - Things like project management, onboarding new team members, working with product team to break down product roadmap goals into technical deliverables, production support - these are all skills that members of your team need to learn

## Challenging Situations: Strategies for Saying No

- A key part of a manager's job is making it easy for employees to get things done
  - Cultivates camaraderie and friendship on the team, and helps people learn new skills
  - Enabler, coach, and champion
- *Being able to say no is key ot achieving the above*

### "Yes, and"

- *Yes, we can do that project, and all we will need to do is delay the start of this other project on the roadmap*
- Force a conversation around priority of work instead of just focusing on the disagreement

### Create Policies

- Policy consists of the hard requirements that must be met in order ot say yes, and some guidelines for thinking about the decision
- Making a policy helps your team know in advance the cost of getting to "yes"
- Ex: if someone wants to pick up a new programming language, the policy around the decision of whether we do that should be known

### "Help Me Say Yes"

- Policies are useful, but don't cover every case
- This works better when there is no clear policy
- "Help me say yes" means you ask questions and dig in on the elements that seem so questionable to you

### Appeal to Budget

- Lay out current workload in plain terms, and show there is little room to maneuver
- Be careful that "not right now" because of a budgetary reason does not imply "we can do this later" if that's not true

### Work as a Team

### Don't Prevaricate

- When you know that you need to say no, it's better to quickly say it than to delay and drag out the process
- You will be wrong sometimes, so when you discover that you were to quick to say no, apologize for making that mistake

### Ask the CTO: My Tech Lead Isn't Managing

- Delegation failures happen
- Set clear expectations and ask questions
- Work with your tech lead to give them the skills and confidence to ask for reports from other members of the team

## Technical Elements Beyond Code

- There's more to running effective engineering teams than pure management skills
- Technical focus needs to be turned to observing and improving systems of work that your developers are operating within
- Need to develop an eye for technical health signals from the team
- There are several questions you can answer to help predict team productivity and satisfaction
  - Do I know what is expected of me at work?
  - Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
  - Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
- For most engineers, the answers to these questions can be discerned by the speed and frequency by which they push code
- Health signals like frequency of code releases, frequency of code check-ins, and frequency of incidents are key indicators

## Measuring the Health of Your Development Team

### Frequency of Releases

- Frequency of code change is one of the leading indicators of a healthy engineering team
- Great managers know how to create environments where their team can move fast, and part of moving fast requires breaking down work into small chunks
- If you don't release frequently, think about why you don't
- As a technical leader, while you may not be writing code much, you're still responsible for the technical side of getting work done

### Frequency of Code Check-ins

- Engineers who don't write tests often have a harder time breaking down their work, and learning how to do test-driven development can help them get better at this skill
- As a new manager, you may need to tell people who have been writing code a lot longer than you that their style needs updating

### Frequency of Incidents

- How stable is the software being produced by the team?
- Determining the level of software quality you need for the product you're building and adjusting that measure over time is a technical challenge for you, the manager, to help address
- If you're building a brand new product for a small but growing business, it may be more important to focus on features over stability 
- On the other hand, if you wn mission-critical-systems, stability and incident minimization may be your top priority
- Balance risk in such a way that neither incident frequency not incident prevention turns into a job that takes developers away from writing code for days at a time

------------

- As a manager, don't take yourself out of the incident management role
- The core of incident management should be working to reduce them
- Focus on providing time to actually design systems that are more stable, or writing code to fix the recurring incidents as they arise
- Be careful, incident prevention should not be "over-focused" on

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: Us Versus Them, Team Player

- Be careful not to make your team feel superior to other teams
- When you build a team identity around superiority (special compared to other teams), the team can lose sight of it's company specific goals
- Rallying a team in this way is *shallow binding* that is vulnerable to many dysfunctions
  - **Fragile to the loss of the leader**
    - Group likely to leave if leader leaves
  - **Resistant to outside ideas**
  - **Empire building**
    - Managers like this tend to try to just grow their team w/o thinking what is best for the overall organization
  - **Inflexibility**
    - Reorgs, cancelled projects, and shifting focus can cause breaks in the core parts of their identity

---------------

- **Durable teams are build on a shared purpose that comes from the company itself, and they align themselves with the company's value**
- Clear understanding of company's missing and they see how their team fits into this mission
- By creating a strong and enduring alignment between the team, its individuals, and company, this creates *purpose-based binding*
  - **Resilient to loss of individuals**
  - **Driven to find better ways to achieve their purpose**
  - **First-team focused**
  - **OPen to changes that serve their purpose**

## The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience

- Impatience and laziness *when applied to process* are the key elements to focus
- Be impatient to figure out the nut of what's important
- As a leader, any time you see something being done that's inefficient, question it
  - Why does this feel inefficient?
  - What is the value in the thing we are doing?
  - Can we deliver that value faster?
  - Can we strip down this project into something simpler and get it done more quickly?
- Problem is when a manager asks whether something can be done fast, most teams interpret this as working more
- *Faster* here really means delivering about the same value to the company in less total time
- As a new manager you may need to work more until you get comfortable, *make sure this habit does not extend to your team*
- Constantly ask yourself:
  - Can I do this faster?
  - Do I need to be doing this at all?
  - What value am I providing with this work?
